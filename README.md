## Somethings To Know:
- You will be required a MongoDB database (Free 500mb). Without one the bot will not run. There a no plans to support other platforms as of now.
- Sometimes for some users, ruamel does not work. Your best bets are to A) Uninstall ruamel.yaml and reinstall ModernLevels. B) Use a different way of handling config files.
- If changing the colours of the bots embeds breaks the bot, replace the # in the hex code to 0x.
- If you recieve an error when running the bot, make sure you have both Privileged Gateway Intents enabled! If that doesn't work, feel free to join the discord server.

---------------
## Setup:

- Firstly, clone the Modern Levels Repository from this page. Once completed, run 'install.bat'. This will install all required dependincies for the bot to work.
- Next, You will be required to create a MongoDB database. If you need help with this, feel free to join the support server, listed above.
- You will then need to insert your Bots Token inside config.yml. After that, you can customise the bot then you're all set!
